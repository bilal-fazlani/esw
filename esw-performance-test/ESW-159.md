# Steps for ESW-159 test
This test measures the infrastructure overheads (passing commands/sequences through a hierarchy of sequencers and assemblies/hcds)

This test involves three test scenarios:

* Scenario-1(akka-only): Test Client -> OCS sequencer -> IRIS sequencer -> Test Assembly -> Test HCD
* Scenario-2(through gateway): HTTP APP → Gateway --> OCS sequencer → IRIS sequencer → Test Assembly -> Test HCD
* Scenario-3(http client): HTTP APP(sequencer http client) →  OCS sequencer → IRIS sequencer → Test Assemebly -> Test HCD

@@@note
As this tests all the above scenarios at once, it requires setting up all the prerequisite services like 
location-service(basic pre-requisite), auth-service and gateway service(only for scenario-2), etc. The steps for 
setting these up are stated below.

Steps for this test.

* Machine 1 - Test Client
* Machine 2 - Gateway, IRIS sequencer
* Machine 3 - ESW sequencer, Test assembly, Test HCD
 
#### Machine 1 setup:

* start location-service and auth-service
```bash
cs launch csw-services:<latest CSW SHA> -- start -k 
```

**Note:**

Before starting location service remember to set the following environment variables:
* CLUSTER_SEEDS=<ip-address-machine-1>:5552
* INTERFACE_NAME
* TMT_LOG_HOME

### Machine 2 setup:
* start location-service 
```bash
cs launch location-server -- --clusterPort=5552
```

* start gateway server
```bash
cs launch gateway-server -- start -l true -c <path-to-command-roles.conf>
```    

* start IRIS sequencer

**Note:**

Since the script for this sequencer is specifically for the performance test, it is present in the esw-performance-test
module of esw repo. Hence, we need to clone the esw repo and perform a publishLocal(sbt publishLocal).

Before starting location service remember to set the following environment variables:
* CLUSTER_SEEDS=<ip-address-machine-1>:5552
* INTERFACE_NAME
* TMT_LOG_HOME

```bash
cs launch --channel file://<path-to-apps.json-in-resource-folder> ocs-app -- sequencer -s "IRIS" -n "IRIS._1" -m  "perfTest"
```


### Machine 3 setup:
* start location-service 
```bash
cs launch location-server -- --clusterPort=5552
```

* start ESW sequencer

**Note:**

Since the script for this sequencer is specifically for the performance test, it is present in the esw-performance-test
module of esw repo. Hence, we need to clone the esw repo and perform a publishLocal(sbt publishLocal).

```bash
cs launch --channel file://<path-to-apps.json-in-resource-folder> ocs-app -- sequencer -s "ESW" -n "ESW._1" -m "perfTest"
```

* start Test assembly and hcd

**Note:**

Clone `esw` repository 

Before starting container app set the following environment variables:
* INTERFACE_NAME

```bash
   sbt 'esw-performance-test/runMain esw.performance.components.SampleContainerCmdApp --local <path-to-sample-container-conf-in-resources>'
```
