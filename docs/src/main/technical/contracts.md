# ESW Service Contracts

Most ESW Services support both Akka-based communication and HTTP-based communication. The HTTP-based interfaces
are documnted according to a contract specified by CSW and ESW in terms of JSON model files. A client following
these contracts is able to communcate with the services using HTTP. The contracts are generated by the source and
are always correct, but may change between major versions.

The omplete ESW service contracts to access Http/Websocket endpoints can be found below:
